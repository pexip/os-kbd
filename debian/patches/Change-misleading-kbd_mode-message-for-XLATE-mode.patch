Subject: Change misleading kbd_mode message for XLATE mode

Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/546712
Forwarded: no

The text said "default (ASCII) mode", which is wrong in two respects:
XLATE isn't limited to 7-bit ASCII, but works with various 8-bit
charsets, and the XLATE mode hasn't been the kernel default for a while.
Thanks for the hint go to Samuel Thibault <sthibault@debian.org>.

The usage of kbd_mode together with grep in shell scripts might become
an issue with this commit, though cursory research with
codesearch.google.com shows only the BiCon project
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/bicon/>, which does "kbd_mode | grep -q
-i Unicode" and is thus unaffected.
