kbd (2.0.3-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  The kbd init script is no longer supported. If configuration in
  /etc/kbd/config and /etc/kbd/remap is unmodified there will be an
  attempt to automatically clean up those files as well as the
  /etc/init.d/kbd init script on upgrades, if not THEY ARE LEFT IN PLACE
  and considered owned by the local admin.

  Most people probably use console-setup to configure their console, but
  this is not a requirement on Debian. We prefer always having something
  arond that configures the console which is why we don't
  unconditionally drop the above files.

  You can use the following command to check if you have console-setup
  installed: dpkg-query -s console-setup

  If it says "...is not installed..." you might want to start using
  console-setup by installing it: apt-get install console-setup

  Unless you know you want to keep using the obsolete init script and
  maintain it yourself you're recommended to make sure they are removed
  using the following commands:
  rm -f /etc/init.d/kbd /etc/kbd/config /etc/kbd/remap && rmdir /etc/kbd
  update-rc.d -f kbd remove
